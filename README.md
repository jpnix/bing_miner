# Bing Miner POC

Back in 2014 Microsoft wanted people to use bing so bad they would give you $5 amazon giftcards just for looking up things on bing with various devices for x amount of searches.

This shell script automates the process of searching random dictionary words in bing to generate the points needed for the gift cards.

Since this promotion is long gone I figured it would be okay to finally after almost a decade to share.

## Legal

This was only a Proof of Concept. I never cashed in any points and received no kind of reward as part of this program, I simply wanted to know if it was possible.
